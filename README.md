# Basics of web dataviz

## Create and deploy a website

### [GitHub](https://github.com), the place to host your code 
- Create an account
- Create a repository
- Download the [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com) or use the [command line](http://git-scm.com)
- Add a README file
  > Install a nice text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io),
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
  [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- Do your first commit and publish it!

### Deploy your code
- Create a branch named `gh-pages`
  > Tip: set `gh-pages` as default branch in your repository settings
- Create an index.html file with some content
- Observe it live on `your-github-name.github.io/repository-name`!

### Preview your code locally
- Install a webserver on your computer
  > Try [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/) which is a very simple one
- Make it serve your repository's directory

## From scratch to a basic webpage
- Find a basic HTML page template such as [http://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/]
- Adapt it to your needs

### Styling
- Import a style framework in your project like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  > Tip: to avoid downloading it and add it to your repo,
  include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Get the 
  code to be included from [https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/]
  > More fun: include Font Awesome to add some icons, and/or
  choose a theme from Bootswatch collection to avoid the
  default style
